        <div id="earnings-chart"></div>
        <p>The first chart displays the average weekly earnings of full-time adults across various industries, with a comparison between males and females. It reveals several important trends:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mining</strong> is the highest-paying industry for both males and females, with males earning significantly more than females, showcasing a noticeable gender pay gap.</li>
            <li>Industries like <strong>Information Media & Telecommunications</strong>, <strong>Financial & Insurance Services</strong>, and <strong>Professional, Scientific & Technical Services</strong> also rank high in terms of earnings for both genders. However, a closer look reveals that males consistently earn more than females in these fields.</li>
            <li>On the lower end of the spectrum, industries such as <strong>Accommodation & Food Services</strong> and <strong>Retail Trade</strong> have the lowest weekly earnings, but the gender pay gap in these sectors appears to be less pronounced.</li>
            <li>Overall, males tend to earn more than females in almost every industry, though the magnitude of the gap varies significantly depending on the sector.</li>
